Feature: Book creation
  In order to sell books
  As the bookseller
  I need to be able to store books

  Rules:
    - A book has a title
    - A book has at least one author
    - A book has a release date
    - A book has a positive price > 0
    - A book has a category
    - A book has a stock

  Scenario: Adding a book from a known author
    Given there is book called "Arduino Sketches: Tools and Techniques for Programming Wizardry" written by "James Langbridge"
    When I set "Arduino Sketches: Tools and Techniques for Programming Wizardry" as title
    And I set "James Langbridge" as the author
    And I set "2014-12-31" as release date
    And I set "20" as price in euro
    And I set "boring" a category
    And I stock "30" copies
