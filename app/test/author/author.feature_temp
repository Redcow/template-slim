Feature: Author creation
  In order to add books to library
  As the bookseller
  I need to be able to store authors

  Rules:
  - Author must have a first name
  - Author must have a last name

  Scenario: Creating a new author called "James Langbridge"
    Given there is an author called "James Langbridge" which has written a book called "Arduino Sketches: Tools and Techniques for Programming Wizardry"
    When I set "James" as his first name
    And I set "Langbridge" as his last name
    Then I should have a new author in my memory system called "James Langbridge"

  Scenario: Creating an already known author called "James Langbridge"
    Given there is an author called "James Langbridge" which has written a book called "Professional Embedded ARM Development"
    When I set "James" as his first name
    And I set "Langbridge" as his last name
    Then I should not have a new author in my memory system called "James Langbridge"

  Scenario: Creating an anonymous author called "John Doe"
    Given there is an anonymous author which has written a book called "The Book With No Name"
    When I set his first name empty
    And I set his last name empty
    Then I should have a new author in my memory system called "John Doe"
